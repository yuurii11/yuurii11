- 👋 Hi, I’m @yuurii11
- 👀 I’m interested in art!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning German at the moment
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can speak a little bit of German
- For example: Oh, wo ist mein Katze, Francis? Francis, hier, Kätzchen, Kätzchen! Komm her! Oh nein... mein Katze! Mein Katze wird vermisst!! Oh Nein!1
- that meant:  Oh, where is my cat, Francis? Francis, here, kitty, kitty! Come here! Oh no... my cat! My cat is missing!! Oh no!1
